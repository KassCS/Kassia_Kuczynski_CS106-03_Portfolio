### Projects

#### Project 1 Title
 - The inventory manager is a Microsoft Excel project designed to track the purchase prices, selling prices, and other details of 15 products, with proper formatting and calculations.

 - Initial project idea: I came up with my inventory tracker because I love stuffed animals and sell them, and needed a way to keep track of my items. The problem I set out the solve was how to keep track of item prices and costs simply. I need a solution to this problem because, without being able to quickly know the purchase and selling price and their profit margins, I could undercharge or drastically overcharge my items. 


Tools I used: 
Mircosoft Excel 


Challenges I faced:
The challenges I faced in the program were learning how to use cell references and do all the calculations. I had never done profit margin calculations before the project. Learning how to do the “IF” functions and do them correctly was an obstacle; it slowed me down at first when I couldn’t figure it out. However, once I got it, the project was smooth sailing. 


Other Resources: 
The other resource I used was my father, Chuck, who helped me figure out what a profit margin was and how to calculate it. 


Result:
In completing this assignment, I achieved a complete organization of my costs and profits for my business. This created a simple solution to a problem that could cause major issues. I would have wanted to improve my chart's look so that the color of the profit margin extends across columns K and L. I would also want to figure out how to shrink the number of numbers in the profit margin calculation so it looks nicer.  I think I ran out of time originally, but with more I would like to improve that.
